This project was done for my Advanced Operating Systems course at CSUSB.

Part 1:
Creating the simulated disk in which the file system, shell, and table would be run.

Part 2:
Creating the initial file system skeleton (commands for the file system would be added in next part).

Part 3:
Creating a shell program to access and manipulate the file system.

Part 4:
Creating a table of miscellaneous data to be called with a search feature in the shell program.
