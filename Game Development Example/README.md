# Portfolio - Game Development Example

Name: Nate Cottrell<br>
Description: Star Scourge is a prototype of a 2D side-scrolling action sci-fi game developed with C# in the Unity
game engine. The game includes 3 levels with objectives, enemies, an in-game item shop at the beginning of each
level, and moving platforms (in the 3rd level). The sprites for everything were downloaded from opengameart.org and
there is a credits list (in-game and design/programmed by me) giving credit to the authors. I programmed the
player controller, designed the levels including the moving platforms, and designed the UI which includes the
in-game item shop, the skill selection screen, the main UI seen when playing, and the title screen layout
(the logo was done by a teammate). The buttons and enemy AI were made and programmed by my teammates and we
collaborated through Github. I put the project together into the final finished file utilizing a combination
of Github and email.

The game was designed for an Android phone and the included .apk file has the finished project which is has all
three playable levels. The game can also be run from a PC, all the necessary files are in the .zip file. The
controls for the PC version are as follows:

A - move left<br>
D - move right<br>
Space - jump<br>

To fire your weapon, you have to click the "Fire" button on screen.
To open the skills menu, simply click the button in the upper right of the screen (use either 'Escape' or click
the button again to close the skills menu).

The controls for the Android version are self-explanatory, simply tap on the screen whichever button you wish to
have your character perform the desired action. The skills menu is the button in the upper right corner of
the screen.
