This is a program written in Python to filter spam out of emails. When the program runs, it will use a Linear SVC
model and an SVC model, then it will output the confusion matrix and accuracy score for each model.

PLEASE NOTE: The folders containing the mock emails are not included in this repository because they contain tens
of thousands of text files. I have included screenshots of the program successfully running called
"Enron-spam results.JPG" and "Ling-spam results.JPG". Both screenshots first show the confusion matrix followed
by the accuracy score.

These files were taken from my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class.
